# Neovim

Neovim is another Vim fork with a lot of performance, extensibility improves and
the best: extensibility with Lua.

I have some snippets files that should be placed in
`~/.local/share/nvim/snippets`.

The config uses [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as the
package manager and automagically will install it and install the plugins at
startup if already not installed.
