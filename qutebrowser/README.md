# Qutebrowser

Qutebrowser is a Vim-like minimal browser configured in Python. I actually configure Qutebrowser by commands in the browser and them write the config to a Python file with `config-write-py`.  

I have a custom homepage with the source avaiable at [this repo](https://github.com/weebcyberpunk/cool-web-homepage). You'll need to change the path to the homepage with both `set url.default_page` and `set url.start_pages` to wherever you cloned the repo or to another homepage (Qutebrowser's default is [DuckDuckGo](https://start.duckduckgo.com).
