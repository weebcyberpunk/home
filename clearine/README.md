# Clearine configs

Clearine is a logout script. His config should be on `~/.config/`. I changed a few things on the configs to match the Arc Dark theme, work properly with Qtile and use Source Code Pro fonts. On my machine I also edit the default icons on /usr/share/themes/Clearine-Fallback/clearine to be white (#ffffff).

Also, I have a simple suspend script with slock locking the screen. This script should be on /home/$USER/.local/bin.
