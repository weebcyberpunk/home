# Rofi configs

There's nothing much to talk about rofi. I use Arc icon theme on it, so you must install it or change theme. My `gg.rasi` theme is just the rofi Arc Dark theme themed to look like the Arc Dark theme (yeah, I don't know why the rofi theme is called Arc Dark if it don't look nothing like the real Arc theme). It should be placed on `~/.config/rofi/` just like the normal config file.
