# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are theese hidden configuration files for our programs.  
On this repo I save some of my own dotfiles, to quickly load an old configuration and have a backup for they.  

You're free to use, edit and study my dotfiles, as I don't have any right over them.  

Please notice that some files may have their own licenses (usually GNU GPL v2 or v3).

Some of them, like the `cmus/rc` use scripts from my build of the suckless' Dynamic Window Manager in [this repo](https://www.github.com/weebcyberpunk/suckless)  

**Files are organized by directory with the name of the program they belong to. Most directories have READMEs to inform about dependencies, paths, etc.**
